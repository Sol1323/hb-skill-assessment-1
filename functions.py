# NOTE: We haven't given you function signatures or docstrings for these, so
# you'll need to write your own.

   # 1.  Write a function that takes a town name as a string and returns
   #     `True` if it is your hometown, and `False` otherwise.

   # 2.  Write a function that takes a first and last name as arguments and
   #     returns the concatenation of the two names in one string.

   # 3.  Write a function that takes a home town, a first name, and a last name
   #     as arguments, calls both functions from part (a) and (b) and prints
   #     "Hi, 'full name here', we're from the same place!", or "Hi 'full name
   #     here', I'd like to visit 'town name here'!" depending on what the function
   #     from part (a) evaluates to.

   # 4.  Write a function, `is_berry()`, which takes a fruit name as a string
   #     and returns a boolean if the fruit is a "strawberry", "raspberry",
   #     "blackberry", or "currant."

   # 5.  Write another function, shipping_cost(), which calculates shipping
   #     cost by taking a fruit name as a string and calling the `is_berry()`
   #     function within the `shipping_cost()` function. Your function should
   #     return 0 if is_berry() == True, and 5 if is_berry() == False.

   # 6.  Make a function that takes in a fruit name and a list of fruits. It should
   #     return a new list containing the elements of the input list, along with
   #     given fruit, which should be at the end of the new list.

   # 7.  Write a function calculate_price to calculate an item's total cost by
   #     adding tax and any fees required by state law.

   #     Your function will take as parameters (in this order): the base price of
   #     the item, a two-letter state abbreviation, and the tax percentage (as a
   #     two-digit decimal, so, for instance, 5% will be .05). If the user does not
   #     provide a tax rate it should default to 5%.

   #     CA law requires stores to collect a 3% recycling fee, PA requires a $2
   #     highway safety fee, and in MA, there is a Commonwealth Fund fee of $1 for
   #     items with a base price of $100 or less and $3 for items over $100. Fees are
   #     added *after* the tax is calculated.

   #     Your function should return the total cost of the item, including tax and
   #     fees.
